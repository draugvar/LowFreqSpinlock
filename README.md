An implementation of spinlocks that works in an energy efficient fashion, exploiting the capability of last generation hardware and new software components in order to rise or reduce the CPU frequency when running spinlock operation. In particular this work consists in a linux kernel module and a user-space program that make possible to run with the lowest frequency admissible when a thread is spinlocking, waiting to enter a critical section. These changes are thread-grain, which means that only interested threads are affected whereas the system keeps running as usual.
